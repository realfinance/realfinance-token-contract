What is Realfinance?
----------------

Real Finance aims to offer several decentralized products and services for the DeFi ecosystem. They plan on building a swap on the Binance Smart Chain where users can use the platform to swap their different BEP20 tokens. By utilizing their own Refi token, participants in the protocol can use it as means of exchange. Liquidity Providers on the Refi swap will be able to collect profits from trading fees with low risk and they will easily be able to remove liquidity. Liquidity Providers can provide liquidity in the exchange and gain profits based on the trading activities on a pool within the swap. As more users use the platform they plan to offer many trading pools with different returns for the liquidity miners.

Real Finance will also be offering to farm and stake on their platform. On their staking program, they will allow users to stake certain crypto that they are currently not using and lock it up for more rewards. In their Refi Farm program, liquidity providers can lockup their funds and afterward receive a reward for providing liquidity
